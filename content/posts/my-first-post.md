Wellcome to my website, you can expect pretty much everything on here. Rants, advice and random unrelated things. I am hyperfocused on everything I do, and I like sharing what knowledge I gain. I can be stubborn however and will tend to do the things that are "bad practices" only to figure out why it is bad in the first place, and see if there is something I could use from that experiment. Some would call me a mad scientist, but I am not really a sciencist or an engeneer, after all I don't have a diploma, just the courage to try things. So you could say I am a charlatan, and you won't be wrong.
